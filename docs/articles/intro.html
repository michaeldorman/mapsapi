<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#introduction" class="anchor"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>The <code>mapsapi</code> package provides an interface to the Google Maps APIs, currently four of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/overview" target="_blank">Google Maps Direction API</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/overview" target="_blank">Google Maps Distance Matrix API</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview" target="_blank">Google Maps Geocode API</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static/overview" target="_blank">Maps Static API</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Functions <code>mp_directions</code>, <code>mp_matrix</code> and <code>mp_geocode</code> are used to access the Directions, Matrix and Geocode APIs, respectively. They return an <code>xml_document</code> object (package <code>xml2</code>) with the response contents.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Given a <em>directions</em> response, functions <code>mp_get_routes</code> and <code>mp_get_segments</code> can be used to process the response document into a spatial layer. Function <code>mp_get_routes</code> gives each alternative as a separate line, while function <code>mp_get_segments</code> gives each segment (that is, a portion of the route associated with specific driving instructions) as a separate line.</p></li>
<li><p>Given a <em>distance matrix</em> response, function <code>mp_get_matrix</code> can be used to obtain distance/duration matrices.</p></li>
<li><p>Given a <em>geocode</em> response, functions <code>mp_get_points</code> and <code>mp_get_bounds</code> can be used to obtain geocoded locations as a point or polygon (bounds) layer.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The fourth function <code>mp_map</code> is used to access the Maps Static API. It returns a <code>stars</code> raster RGB image, which can be used as background in maps.</p>
</div>
<div id="installation" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#installation" class="anchor"></a>Installation</h2>
<p>The CRAN version can be installed with:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/install.packages.html">install.packages</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"mapsapi"</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The development version can be installed using <code>remotes</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/install.packages.html">install.packages</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"remotes"</span><span class="op">)</span>
<span class="fu">remotes</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu"><a href="https://remotes.r-lib.org/reference/install_github.html">install_github</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"michaeldorman/mapsapi"</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Once installed, the package can be loaded with <code>library</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html">library</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va"><a href="https://michaeldorman.github.io/mapsapi/">mapsapi</a></span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>A Google Maps APIs key is required to use the package:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">key</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"AIz....."</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div id="directions" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#directions" class="anchor"></a>Directions</h2>
<p>The following expression queries the Directions API for driving directions from Tel-Aviv and Haifa. Note that locations can be specified as a coordinate pair, a textual address or an <code>sf</code> spatial object. For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">doc</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/mp_directions.html">mp_directions</a></span><span class="op">(</span>
  origin <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/c.html">c</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fl">34.81127</span>, <span class="fl">31.89277</span><span class="op">)</span>,
  destination <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"Haifa"</span>,
  alternatives <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">TRUE</span>,
  key <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">key</span>,
  quiet <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">TRUE</span>
<span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively, we can use the sample response data included in the packages:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html">library</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va"><a href="https://xml2.r-lib.org/">xml2</a></span><span class="op">)</span>
<span class="va">doc</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="http://xml2.r-lib.org/reference/as_xml_document.html">as_xml_document</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">response_directions_driving</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Given the response object, we can use <code>mp_get_routes</code> to create a spatial layer of route lines:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">r</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/mp_get_routes.html">mp_get_routes</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">doc</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here is the resulting object:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">r</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>mp_map</code> function can be used to access the Maps Static API to download an RGB image with a map.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb28"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">r</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu"><a href="../reference/mp_map.html">mp_map</a></span><span class="op">(</span>center <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"31.253205,34.791914"</span>, zoom <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fl">14</span>, key <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">key</span>, quiet <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">TRUE</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Alternatively, we can use the sample response data included with the package:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb29"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">r</span> <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">response_map</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The result is a <code>stars</code> raster, which can be plotted with <code>plot</code>:</p>
